\frametitle{Properties of different actions}
It turns out that some of the properties we've seen behave nicely and have certain properties:
\begin{itemize}
\item<2-> The $G$-boundary property is preserved under quotients,
\item<3-> Strongly proximality is preserved under taking products,
\item<4-> If $G \acts Y$ is minimal and $X$ is a $G$-boundary, then any continuous $G$-map $\varphi \colon Y \to X$ will be unique and surjective.
\end{itemize}
