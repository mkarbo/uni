A discrete group is $C^*$-simple if the reduced group $C^*$-algebra $C_r^*(G)$ has no non-trivial proper two-sided closed ideals, and it has the unique trace property if the canonical tracial state on $C_r^*(G)$ is the only tracial state. In 1975 Powers published an article proving that the free group on two generators is $C^*$-simple and has the unique trace property. His result and calculations has then been generalized vastly, and some of these results will be dealt with in this thesis. In 2014 \cite{bko} was released, using theory of boundary actions of discrete groups $G$ on compact Hausdorff spaces to classify when $G$ is $C^*$-simple, respectively, has the unique trace property, and to show that $C^*$-simplicity implies the unique trace property. Then, in 2015, the article \cite{haagerup2015new}, which is due to the late Uffe Haagerup, was released. In this article there were given new proofs of exactly when a discrete group $G$ is $C^*$-simple, respectively, has the unique trace property using boundary actions. We will in this thesis describe $C^*$-simplicity and the unique trace property in terms of both Dixmier properties and by properties using boundary actions of $G$.
