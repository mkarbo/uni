\chapter{Integral Forms And Representation Theory}
Suppose that you are given a discrete $C^*$-dynamical system $(A,G,\alpha)$, here descrete menas that $G$ is discrete. It is not hard to extend representations of $G$ and $A$ to the group ring $\C_C(G,A)$, and thus create new $C^*$-algebras through completion of it. However, when $G$ is not discrete, we run into issues since we can not assume that a unitary representation of $G$ is continuous in norm, which is required by classic constructions seen e.g., in \cite{brown2008c}. We will in this chapter develop the necessary theory to define the non-discrete analogues of these techniques.
