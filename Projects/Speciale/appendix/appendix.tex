\sssection{Integration Theory In Groups}
Integration over groups plays a vital role in the theory developed and processed throughout this thesis. Therefore, we will build some of the cornerstone results in this theory, which will be used frequently. We will by $G$ denote an arbitrary locally compact group, and by $X$ an arbitrary Banach space. We will fix a left-Haar measure $\mu$ on $G$, whose integrand we denote by $\d t$.

For $f \in \cc(G)$ and $x \in X$, we denote by $f \otimes x$ the map $G \ni t \mapsto f(t)x \in X$. It is clear that then $f \otimes x \in \cc(G,X)$.
