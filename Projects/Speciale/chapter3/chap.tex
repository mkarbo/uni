\chapter{Simplicity Of Crossed Products}
As previously mentioned, we will now begin describing the theory, both old and new, describing the ideal structure of crossed products $A \rtimes_\alpha G$ for topological groups $G$. We will begin by introducing some new structures and concepts associated to this theory.
